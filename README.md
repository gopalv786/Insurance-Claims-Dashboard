🏢 Business Scenario: AryaShield Insurance Ltd.

🧩 Background

AryaShield Insurance Ltd. is a mid-sized insurance provider operating across five regions in India. They offer Health, Auto, Life, and Travel policies to over 100,000 customers. Despite strong growth in policy sales, the company is facing operational inefficiencies and rising claim costs, which are impacting profitability and customer satisfaction

🚨 Business Problems

1. High Claim Settlement Time
Claims are taking too long to settle, especially in the Health and Auto segments.
Customers are frustrated, leading to poor retention and negative reviews.

2. Unbalanced Risk Exposure
Underwriters are unable to clearly identify which policy types or regions carry higher risk.
Loss ratios are climbing, especially in the South and West zones.

3. Low Visibility into Agent Performance
AryaShield works with 100+ agents, but lacks insight into who’s driving profitable policies vs. risky ones.
Incentive programs are misaligned with actual performance.

4. Fragmented Customer Insights
Marketing and underwriting teams don’t have a unified view of customer segments.
High-income customers are under-targeted, while low-income segments show higher claim frequency.

🎯 Project Goal

To build a Power BI analytics solution that helps AryaShield:
Reduce claim settlement time
Identify and manage high-risk policies
Optimize agent performance
Segment customers for better targeting
Improve overall profitability

📊 Data Model Overview

Customers – Demographic and contact information for policyholders
Agents – Sales agents responsible for policy issuance and customer onboarding
Regions – Geographic mapping for customers, agents, and claims
PolicyTypes – Classification of insurance products (e.g., health, auto, life)
Time – Date dimension used for time-based analysis and reporting
